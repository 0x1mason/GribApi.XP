## GribApi.XP

GribApi.XP is a friendly fork of the ECMWF's GRIB API. It makes a few changes to improve cross-platform (that's the `XP`) parity of features and packages. At the moment, that mostly means improving support for Windows, but changes for all platforms are welcome.

### GRIB Tools Packages

#### Chocolatey (Windows)

To install the GRIB tools from [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/grib-tools), run
```shell
C:\> choco install grib-tools
```
